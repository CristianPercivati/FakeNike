# FakeNike

This is an example of how a legitimate page can be easily cloned/emulated and used for phishing purposes, only for educational purpouses. 

It has nothing to do with Nike, it won't store any kind of data nor send it to anywhare else. It's pure frontend and css emulation.

This example will be used as an educational project for a faculty subject "Educational Technologies".

I used Bulma, fontawesome icons, css, and vanilla JS for this.
